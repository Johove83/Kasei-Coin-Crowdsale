# Kasei Crowdsale Funding
### Johnathan Overton


## Overview of the Analysis

* The purpose of this file is to demonstrate the ability to utilize Solidity in order to create an ERC-20 compliant fungible token, kaseiCoin, in order to deploy a Crowdsales contract.

* In this model, the following technologies were incorporated:
  * Solidity
  * Ganache
  * Remix IDE
  * OpenZeppelin
  * MetaMask

* How to Use
  * Install MetaMask extension on local browser
  * Connect Ganache to Remix IDE
  * Compile solidity files
  * Deploy Deployer and use addresses to deploy Coin and Coin Deployer contracts

In order of appearance, the previous images show the successful compilation of the token, crowdsale, and deployment contracts.

### Original Account Balances

The above image shows that the crowdsale account has a beginning balance of 99.92 ETH and two funding accounts have a starting balance of 100 ETH.

### After Purchasing Token Balances

After sending 10 and 28 ETH each funding accounts one and two show balances of 90 and 72 ETH. Further, the crowdsales account shows a gain of 38 ETH. This is further verified by the following image which demostrates that the account has successfully gained 38 ETH.
